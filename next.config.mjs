        summary:
          "In this HIP, we propose an amendment to HIP 19 to enable a new type of IoT network actor: a Secure Concentrator Card (SCC). A Secure Concentrator Card is similar to a standard LoRaWAN concentrator card, but with an additional Secure Microcontroller Unit (SMCU) and onboard GPS receiver. The SMCU digitally signs LoRa data packets as they are received from the radio. In this way, packet data and its corresponding metadata (RSSI, Frequency, GPS location and time) can be verified to be authentic. The primary intention of this HIP is to combat Proof-of-Coverage gaming. Secure Concentrtors achieve this by providing trustworthy data upon which better gaming detectors and PoC algorithms can be built.",

Currently there are 100,000,000 (10^8) bones per HNT and under the proposed redenomination the conversion rate would be adjusted to 100,000 (10^5) bones per HNT.

          "HIP 59 proposes a change for how fees are calculated when doing a XOR filter update with the goal of reducing these fees and enabling more updates to XOR filters. \n\nOn the Helium blockchain, fees are calculated based on the byte_size of the transaction. XOR filter fees are operational costs related to maintaining OUIs on the blockchain. With the current implementation as more devices get added to the filter, it grows. Meaning that any update is calculated based on the full size of the filter. This can increase the cost of an XOR filter update to tens of thousands of Data Credits (DC). This is not sustainable as the network grows.\n\nHIP 59 proposes to not account for the full size of the XOR filter every time but only the difference compared to the previous update. For example: if the previous XOR had a size of 100 bytes and the update is 110 bytes then fees would be calculated on the difference: (110 - 100 = 10) 10 bytes. \n\nIf approved this approach increases the commercial viability for community members to host a Console/Router instance, since only the difference of the XOR filter will be calculated vs paying for the entire amount each time.",

Complexities not accounted for in the HIP meant the immediate implementation of HIP39 would come at the cost of significantly higher engineering time than initially allotted. The initial proposal would have introduced a HNT token arbitrage, putting network integrity at risk – among other concerns.\n\nA vote for HIP 67 means no implementation of HIP 39 should take place.\nA vote against HIP 67 means HIP 39 should be implemented.\n\nWe will consider this proposal as approved if it passes with 2/3 of the vote power by the deadline.\n\nJoin the conversation on Discord and see the existing #hip‑39‑hnt‑redenomination channel for more details.",

The Helium network operated on AU915 sub-band 2 (SB2) until November 2022, when it was switched to an AS923-1 variant with support for AU915 sensors on SB6.\n\nA breakdown of the two options presented are as follows:\n\n➤ Return to AU915 plan with support for AU915 sensors on SB2\n\nThis option will re-enable support for all AU915 SB2 sensors as was the case prior to the chain variable change in November 2022. This option is currently supported by all known manufacturers but the Helium Foundation will confirm before pushing this configuration change.\n\n1. AU915 sensors will work on the network at 22dBm, some possibly higher.\n2. AU915 sensors on SB2 join the network faster vs sometimes not at all on AS923-1C\n3. Full support by Chirpstack and other LNS options (rather than having to split LNS for AU915 vs AS923 sensors).\n4. Helium continues to be part of the Australian public LoRaWAN network ecosystem. Private, commercial and public operators can roam the network.\n\nThis proposal has been presented by existing members of the AU community as a draft HIP which is linked as More Details on this page.\n\n➤ Remain on AS923-1C Plan with a power adjustment to 27 dBm\n\nThis option retains the existing "dual plan" for AS923 sensors and limited support for some AU915 sensors on SB6. Assuming hardware/firmware support from manufacturers, this option also allows for a power increase that should match prior expectations on power for Proof-of-Coverage. Specific additional details:\n\n1. AS923 sensors will work on the network at 16dBm, some possibly higher.\n2. AS923 is a dynamic frequency plan and can take advantage of upcoming spectrum changes in the region.\n3. Due to only two join channels AS923 sensors join the network faster.\n4. Commercial operators have expressed interest in roaming on AS923 but we are not aware of existing roaming activity at scale.\n\nIt should be noted that Proof-of-Coverage will be the same from a power perspective for both channel plan options and only operators using the specific frequency plan can roam on Helium Hotspots regardless of choice.\n\nPrevious discussions can be found on Discord: https://discord.gg/helium\n\nVoting on this temperature check implies that the community has reviewed the two options and is providing guidance to the Helium Foundation on a path forward of implementation in the IoT Configuration Service.\n\nJoin the conversation on Discord in the #hip-discussion channel for more details.',
