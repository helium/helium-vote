          "HIP 59 proposes a change for how fees are calculated when doing a XOR filter update with the goal of reducing these fees and enabling more updates to XOR filters. \n\nOn the Helium blockchain, fees are calculated based on the byte_size of the transaction. XOR filter fees are operational costs related to maintaining OUIs on the blockchain. With the current implementation as more devices get added to the filter, it grows. Meaning that any update is calculated based on the full size of the filter. This can increase the cost of an XOR filter update to tens of thousands of Data Credits (DC). This is not sustainable as the network grows.\n\nHIP 59 proposes to not account for the full size of the XOR filter every time but only the difference compared to the previous update. For example: if the previous XOR had a size of 100 bytes and the update is 110 bytes then fees would be calculated on the difference: (110 - 100 = 10) 10 bytes. \n\nIf approved this approach increases the commercial viability for community members to host a Console/Router instance, since only the difference of the XOR filter will be calculated vs paying for the entire amount each time.",

          "HIP 51 seeks to allow Helium and its token HNT to become a ‘Network of Networks’, opening the door for multiple network protocols and multiple tokens to exist in the ecosystem. \n\nFor the IoT network, Hotspots would start earning a new token called $IOT, while 5G Hotspots would earn a token called $MOBILE. All new tokens are backed by HNT and can always be converted to HNT. Existing holdings of HNT remain unaffected.\n\nThis HIP provides a general structure for onboarding new network protocols, of which HIP 52: LoRaWAN DAO and HIP 53: 5G DAO exist as two current proposals. HIP 51 aims to create an economy where the underlying HNT-Data Credit burn-and-mint equilibrium continues to power the Helium Flywheel, while Proof-of-Coverage rules and earnings are dictated by each corresponding subDAO.\n\nApproving this HIP implies that the community has reviewed the implementation. We will consider this proposal as approved if it passes with 2/3 of the vote power by the deadline.\n\nJoin the conversation on Discord and see the #hip‑51‑helium-dao channel for more details.",

          "HIP 52 establishes the Helium IoT subDAO and subtoken under the framework established by HIP 51. This subDAO will manage the Helium LoRaWAN network, the IOT token, and governance operations for IoT networks. Oracles in the IoT subDAO will confirm Proof of Coverage, data transfer activity, and add blocks to the IoT subnetwork.\n\nIoT subDAO participants may lock and delegate IOT tokens as veIOT to gain voting power in IoT governance and/or run oracles. HNT tokens will be emitted to the subDAO treasury as required by HIP 51 and will back the IOT token. The IOT token will be redeemable for HNT through a programmatic treasury controlled by the IoT subDAO.\n\nApproving this HIP implies that the community has reviewed the implementation.
