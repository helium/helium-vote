          "HIP 59 proposes a change for how fees are calculated when doing a XOR filter update with the goal of reducing these fees and enabling more updates to XOR filters. \n\nOn the Helium blockchain, fees are calculated based on the byte_size of the transaction. XOR filter fees are operational costs related to maintaining OUIs on the blockchain. With the current implementation as more devices get added to the filter, it grows. Meaning that any update is calculated based on the full size of the filter. This can increase the cost of an XOR filter update to tens of thousands of Data Credits (DC). This is not sustainable as the network grows.\n\nHIP 59 proposes to not account for the full size of the XOR filter every time but only the difference compared to the previous update. For example: if the previous XOR had a size of 100 bytes and the update is 110 bytes then fees would be calculated on the difference: (110 - 100 = 10) 10 bytes. \n\nIf approved this approach increases the commercial viability for community members to host a Console/Router instance, since only the difference of the XOR filter will be calculated vs paying for the entire amount each time.",

Complexities not accounted for in the HIP meant the immediate implementation of HIP39 would come at the cost of significantly higher engineering time than initially allotted.

          "HIP-75 proposes to begin MOBILE minting on the Helium L1 alongside a revised MOBILE emissions curve. These proposed changes do not affect the monthly rewards that current MOBILE Hotspot deployers earn, which will continue to be 3 Billion MOBILE tokens per month. The proposed solution maintains rewards continuity for Hotspot owners between the premine and the permanent solution of L1 minting. The proposed new curve maintains rewards distributions as they are today to match the development pace of Mobile Proof-of-Coverage more closely. Under the current emissions schedule, and without this new curve, a large number of tokens would be minted in a shorter period, front-loading MOBILE rewards while decreasing later MOBILE rewards.\n\nThis HIP affects only the Helium 5G network and has no impact on HNT rewards. \n\nApproving HIP-75 implies that the community has reviewed the implementation.

The Helium network operated on AU915 sub-band 2 (SB2) until November 2022, when it was switched to an AS923-1 variant with support for AU915 sensors on SB6.\n\nA breakdown of the two options presented are as follows:\n\n➤ Return to AU915 plan with support for AU915 sensors on SB2\n\nThis option will re-enable support for all AU915 SB2 sensors as was the case prior to the chain variable change in November 2022. This option is currently supported by all known manufacturers but the Helium Foundation will confirm before pushing this configuration change.\n\n1. AU915 sensors will work on the network at 22dBm, some possibly higher.\n2. AU915 sensors on SB2 join the network faster vs sometimes not at all on AS923-1C\n3. Full support by Chirpstack and other LNS options (rather than having to split LNS for AU915 vs AS923 sensors).\n4. Helium continues to be part of the Australian public LoRaWAN network ecosystem. Private, commercial and public operators can roam the network.\n\nThis proposal has been presented by existing members of the AU community as a draft HIP which is linked as More Details on this page.\n\n➤ Remain on AS923-1C Plan with a power adjustment to 27 dBm\n\nThis option retains the existing \"dual plan\" for AS923 sensors and limited support for some AU915 sensors on SB6. Assuming hardware/firmware support from manufacturers, this option also allows for a power increase that should match prior expectations on power for Proof-of-Coverage. Specific additional details:\n\n1. AS923 sensors will work on the network at 16dBm, some possibly higher.\n2. AS923 is a dynamic frequency plan and can take advantage of upcoming spectrum changes in the region.\n3. Due to only two join channels AS923 sensors join the network faster.\n4. Commercial operators have expressed interest in roaming on AS923 but we are not aware of existing roaming activity at scale.\n\nIt should be noted that Proof-of-Coverage will be the same from a power perspective for both channel plan options and only operators using the specific frequency plan can roam on Helium Hotspots regardless of choice.\n\nPrevious discussions can be found on Discord: https://discord.gg/helium\n\nVoting on this temperature check implies that the community has reviewed the two options and is providing guidance to the Helium Foundation on a path forward of implementation in the IoT Configuration Service.\n\nJoin the conversation on Discord in the #hip-discussion channel for more details.",

        description:
          "HIP 81 proposes to maintain the DAO Utility Score codified by the community with HIP 51, but defines minimum onboarding fees for subDAOs as $10 with a halving schedule matching the halving schedule of HNT emissions. This proposal seeks to solve the problem created by radios that have not paid an onboarding fee by giving manufacturers and/or the subDAO a grace period ending on August 1, 2023 to retroactively onboard devices on behalf of the radio owners.\n\nDAO Utility Score as proposed in HIP 81 is V × D × A, where\nV is veHNT delegated to a particular subDAO\nD is (DCs burned by a particular subDAO)^(½)\nA is (Active Hotspots in subDAO × Onboarding Fee)^(\¼)\n\nApproving HIP 81 implies that the community has reviewed the implementation. \n\nThe HIP 81 vote is running concurrently with HIP 80. Both proposals should be voted on independently.\n\nWe would consider this proposal as approved if it passes with 2/3 of the vote power by the deadline. If both fail to reach a super majority, the original DAO Utility Score specified in HIP 51 will be implemented.\n\nJoin the conversation on Discord and see the #hip-81-minimum-onboarding-fee channel for more details.",
